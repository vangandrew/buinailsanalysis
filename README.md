# buinailsanalysis
Since working at BUI Nails Lounge as a Data Analyst and since learning Python, I figured to do Sentiment Analysis on customer reviews on Yelp. 
This project goes over web scraping only the reviews (p tags) out of the divs, and then using pandas and numpy to store data in an array, then using NLTK and TextBlob to do Sentiment Analysis.
